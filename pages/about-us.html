                        In 2012, Vestbirk Musik- & Sportsefterskole bought the old riding centre, which was part of the expansion of an ambitious riding line that could be offered to the school's students. A unique opportunity for a post-secondary school to be able to offer.

                    <p>
                        However, the existing buildings were in a slight state of disrepair and it was the plan from the start that new buildings were required if the quality of the facilities was to reach the desired level.

                    <h5>New surroundings</h5>
                    <p>
                        In 2018, the construction of the new buildings began and without major delays they were ready for inauguration the following year.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The new riding center, Vestbirk Sportsridingcenter, reflects the high level the post-secondary school wants to set for the riding line. Therefore, things have not been spared either.
                        With the riding center's large bright halls, riding and stable halls, both horse and rider have a formidable environment to move in.
                        In addition, the riding center is equipped with 2 Walber ebb/river fiber riding tracks and 84 Röwer & Rüb horse boxes.

                    <p>
                        Vestbirk Sportsridecenter's primary task is to be available to students of Vestbirk Musik- & Sportsefterskole's Riding line.

                    <p>
                        Fortunately, the riding center is of such a size that we can easily offer private individuals to use the facilities, or rent out our premises for rallies or other events.
